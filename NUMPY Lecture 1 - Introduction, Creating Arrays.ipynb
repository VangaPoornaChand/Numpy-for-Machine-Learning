The image is of 10 pixels  height and 8 pixels of width. Therefore the shape of the image is (10,8) Hence the output for the line  print(\"Shape of image :\",IMAGE.shape) is (10,8). And as we read the image in GRAYSCALE format, The dimentions for that image is 2. If we have read the image in color format then the dimentions would be 3.\n",
